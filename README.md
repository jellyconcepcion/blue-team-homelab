# Blue Team Homelab

This repository documents my hands-on Blue Team and SOC engineering projects.  
The goal is to build **realistic, professional-grade security monitoring labs** that demonstrate log collection, detection engineering, and incident analysis.

## 📌 Overview
The lab simulates a small enterprise network where I practice **SOC monitoring, incident detection, vulnerability management, and incident response**.  
It includes multiple virtual machines, log forwarding, and security event detection workflows.

## 🏗️ Lab Architecture
- **SIEM / SOC**: Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu Server 24.04
- **Endpoints**: Ubuntu & Windows 11 Pro
- **Attacker**: Kali Linux
- **Networking**: VirtualBox host-only + NAT

(Include architecture diagrams per project in the `docs/` folder)

## 🚀 Projects
- **01-lab-setup/** – VM creation and base lab environment
- **02-splunk-projects/** – Splunk SIEM projects including log collection, forwarding, and detections
- Future projects: Vulnerability Management, Incident Response Simulation
